/**
 * Approach: Sliding Window (Two Pointers) with Frequency Map (HashMap)
 * 
 * The core of the solution is a sliding window defined by left and right pointers.
 * It counts good pairs without nested loops of O(nÂ²) complexity.
 * 
 * Frequency Map (HashMap) stores the frequency of each number encountered within current window.
 * 
 * Extending the window (`right` pointer) to find a window with `k` number of pairs.
 * 
 * `while (pairsCount >= k)`    when window has number pairs enough to be 'good' subarray,
 *     `result += n - right`    all subarrays starting from left up to and including right are also 'good'
 * 
 * Shrinking the window (left pointer) to find smallest window that meets the criteria, 
 *      accumulating the number of valid windows that end at the current `right` index.
 * 
 * Time: O(n) because pointers of window iterate through `nums` array once.
 * Space: O(n) for frequency map.
