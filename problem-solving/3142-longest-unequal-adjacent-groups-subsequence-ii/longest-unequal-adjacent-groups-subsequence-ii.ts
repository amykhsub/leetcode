/**
 * Approach: Dynamic Programming (Bottom-Up) with
 * - Bit Manipulation with Bitwise XOR (^), Bitwise OR and assign (|=), Left shift (<<)
 * - Hamming Distance
 * - Hash Map
 * 
 * `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest valid subsequence that starts at index `i`.
 * Backward iteration allows to build the lengths of subsequences based on already computed values for later indices.
 * For each word `i` we try to extend subsequence by looking at subsequent words (indices > `i`)
 *      using `maxLength` to track the longest length.
 * `nextWordIndices` array stores an index of the next word in the longest subsequence
 *      that is used for reconstruction of subsequence once the start of the subsequence is found.
 * 
 * Unique bitmask `wordMask` is created to encode each word. It represents concatenated 5-bit masks of each character.
 * 
 * ? why bigint is used for mask
 *      Each character of word is encoded.
 *      26 possible lowercase English letters and 5 bits are sufficient for each character (2^5 = 32 > 26).
 *      For example, if word has a length of 7 it requires 5x7 = 35 bits.
 *      If word is long, total number of bits can exceed the maximum safe integer (2^53-1).
 * 
 * `oneCharDiffMask` is created by flipping the bits corresponding to the character at current position. 
 *      This represents all possible words that differ by 1 character at that position.
 * 
 * The bitmasking allows to group and look up words that are at Hamming distance of 1 from the current word.
 * 
 * Hash Map `maskMap` is used to store `oneCharDiffMask` as key and list of indices of words 
 *      from which the mask can be produced.
 *      If the mask exists in map, it means there're other words in the `words` 
 *          that at Hamming distance of 1 from current word. So we can check 
 *          if some of the indices can be used to extend current subsequence.
 * 
 * `bestStartIndex` variable keeps track of index that starts the overall longest subsequence.
 * 
 * Time: O(n*LÂ²) where `L` is the length of the longest word
 *      - outer loop `for` iterates `n` times
 *      - inner loop for Hamming mutation iterates `L` times
 *      - bitmask generation for each word takes time proportional to `L`
 *      - word insertion into `maskMap` also takes time proportional to `L`
 *      - nested loop is dominant factor involving word length and number of candidates 
 * Space: O(n*L):
 *      - `nextWordIndices` and `dp` take `n` space
 *      - `maskMap` takes `n*L` space
